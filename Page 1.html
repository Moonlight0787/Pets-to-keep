<p> This is an American Shorthair </p>
<img src="Grumpy Cat.jpeg" style="width:250px;height:230px;">
<p> People call this type the Grumpy Cat.</p>
<img src="Colonel Meow.webp" style="width:340px;height:230px;">
<p> This type of cat is Colonel Meow and people must have assumed he was a mad cat so that is the reason it was called this way. (At least that's what I think)</p>
